Random &amp; Fun Projects

-Fun and Random projects I've done in various languages and decided to commit to git :)


======
Project swagGen.js

-Simple javascript code to generate a 'swag' name string to parody and satirise the names you find in online gaming (LoL, DotA, etc). 

//TODO 
-Make better parsing rules so the resultant strings always make sense/are humourous
-Beautify the code (less repetetion etc)
