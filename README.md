## Random &amp; Fun Projects

- Fun and Random projects I've done in various languages and decided to commit to git :)

## Project swagGen.js

- Simple javascript code to generate a 'swag' name string to parody and satirise the names you find in online gaming (LoL, DotA, etc). 

### TODO 
- Make better parsing rules so the resultant strings always make sense/are humourous
- Beautify the code (less repetition etc)

## loz.cfg

- My CS:GO Config file. Feel free to use it. (Delete the binds section unless you want to have my keybinds)

## Project y
